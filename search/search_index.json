Its core is C++11, with a full Python API, allowing for rapid prototyping (in Jupyter, PyCharm, or python CLI), efficient processing (with cross-platform hardware acceleration), and lots of built-in node classes for creative exploration. SignalFlow has robust support for macOS and Linux (including Raspberry Pi), and has work-in-progress support for Windows. The overall project is currently in alpha status, and interfaces may change without warning. This documentation currently focuses specifically on Python interfaces and examples. Overview At its core, SignalFlow has a handful of key concepts. It comprises a graph (or network) of nodes , each of which performs a single function (for example, generating a cyclical waveform, or filtering an input node). Nodes are connected by input and output relationships: the output of one node may be used to control the frequency of another. As the output of the first node increases, the frequency of the second node increases correspondingly. This modulation is applied on a sample-by-sample basis: all modulation in SignalFlow happens at audio rate. Nodes may have multiple inputs , which determine the synthesis properties that can be modulated at runtime. A node can also have buffer properties, which contain audio waveform data that can be read and written to, for playback or recording of samples. Nodes can be grouped in a patch , which is a user-defined configuration of nodes. A patch may have one or more named inputs that are defined by the user when creating the patch. Patches can be thought of like voices of a synthesizer. A patch can also be set to automatically remove itself from the graph when a specified node's playback is complete, which is useful for automatic memory management. Example Let's take a look at the simplest possible SignalFlow example. Here, we create and immediately start the AudioGraph , construct a single-channel sine oscillator with a frequency of 440Hz, connect the oscillator to the graph's output, and run the graph indefinitely. from signalflow import * graph = AudioGraph ( start = True ) sine = SineOscillator ([ 440 , 880 ]) envelope = EnvelopeASR ( 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.5 ) output = sine * env graph . play ( output ) graph . wait () This demo shows a few syntactical benefits that SignalFlow provides to make it easy to work with audio: The 2-item array of frequency values passed to SineOscillator is expanded to create a 2-channel output. If you passed a 10-item array, the output would have 10 channels. Mathematical operators like * can be used to multiply, add, subtract or divide the output of nodes, and creates a new output Node that corresponds to the output of the operation. This example multiplies an envelope with an oscillator. Even through the envelope is mono and the oscillator is stereo, SignalFlow does the right thing and upmixes the envelope's values to create a stereo output, so that the same envelope shape is applied to the L and R channels of the oscillator, before creating a stereo output. This is called \"automatic upmixing\", and is very handy when working with multichannel graphs. In subsequent examples, we will skip the import line and assume you have already imported everything from the signalflow namespace. Info If you want to keep your namespaces better separated, you might want to do something like the below. import signalflow as sf graph = sf . AudioGraph ( start = True ) sine = sf .

It makes it quick and easy to express complex musical ideas, and can send and receive events from various different sources: MIDI, OSC, SocketIO, and .mid files. What isobar does The core objective of isobar is to provide a framework for sequencing and triggering events, which may be MIDI messages, OSC triggers, triggers for third-party DSP engines such as SuperCollider, or even Python functions. ( What types of event are supported? ) It can be used to trigger events in real time, or to generate patterns that can be serialised as MIDI files and loaded into a DAW. It can sync to external clocks, or act as a clock source to external devices. It can also load patterns serialised in MIDI files for processing. What isobar doesn't do isobar does not generate any audio on its own. It must be configured to send events to an output device which is responsible for sound synthesis. Basic concepts There are a few key components in isobar. The Timeline handles timing and scheduling, triggering events at the correct moment. It is made up of multiple Tracks, which normally . It can maintain its own clock with millisecond accuracy, or sync to an external clock. Events correspond to triggers that are typically sent to output devices or received from input devices. These may be MIDI notes, control changes, OSC triggers, and other general types. An event is typically described by a dict with a number of properties. For example: { \"note\" : 60, \"amplitude\": 127 } Patterns : Each of the properties of an event can be specified by a Pattern, which generates a sequence of return values. Simple pattern types generate fixed sequences, random values, or values based on statistical models. Patterns can be passed other patterns as parameters, so they can operate on each other -- for example, causing an input pattern to loop N times, or skipping the input values with some probability.

A pattern is a Python iterator , which is to say it does two things: generates and returns the next item in the sequence when no more items are available in the sequence, raises a StopIteration exception >>> seq = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ], 1 ) >>> next ( seq ) 1 >>> next ( seq ) 2 >>> next ( seq ) 3 >>> next ( seq ) Traceback ( most recent call last ): File \"sequence.py\" , line 46 , in __next__ raise StopIteration StopIteration Note that this means that patterns can't seek backwards in time. Their only concern is generating the next event. By assigning patterns to properties of events , you can specify sequences of values to control any aspect of the control output: pitch, velocity, duration, etc. Patterns can be finite, such as the example above, or infinite, in which case they will keep generating new values forever. Patterns can also typically generate different Python types. Some Pattern classes will seek to do the right thing based on whether they are passed them int or float arguments. PSequence([ \"apple\", \"pear\" ]) generates an alternating pair of strings PWhite(0, 10) generates a stream of ints between [0 .. 9] PWhite(0.0, 10.0) generates a stream of floats between [0.0 .. 10.0] PChoice([ Key(\"C\", \"major\"), Key(\"A\", \"minor\") ]) picks one of the specified Key s at random Pattern resolution When a pattern returns a pattern, the embedded pattern will also be resolved recursively. For example: PChoice([ PSequence([0, 2, 3]), PSequence([7, 5, 2 ]) ]) each step, picks one of the embedded patterns and returns its next value Pattern operators Patterns can be combined and modified using standard Python arithmetic operators, with other patterns or with scalar values. >>> added = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) + 10 >>> next ( added ) 11 >>> next ( added ) 12 >>> multiplied = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) * 4 >>> next ( added ) 4 >>> next ( added ) 8 >>> inverted = 12 - iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> next ( inverted ) 11 >>> next ( inverted ) 10 combined = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) + iso . PSequence ([ 12 , 0 , 12 ]) >>> next ( combined ) 13 >>> next ( combined ) 2 The operators are designed to do what you would expect: binary operators ( + , - , * , / , % , << , >> ) perform the operation on each item of the input patterns. Note that, for binary operators, if either of the inputs returns None , the output value becomes None . equality operators ( < , > , == , != ) can be used to do element-wise comparison on the input sequences, returning a pattern whose values are either True , False or None . abs() can be used to generate the absolute values of a sequence For finite sequences, len() will return the length of the sequence A float pattern can be turned into an int pattern with isobar.PInt(pattern) Duplicating patterns It's often useful to be able to apply the same pattern to multiple properties or events. However, this can result in unwanted behaviours as shown below: >>> a = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> d = iso . PDict ({ \"p1\" : a , \"p2\" : a }) >>> next ( d ) { 'p1' : 1 , 'p2' : 2 } Because the \"p1\" and \"p2\" properties both refer to the same instance, the next() method is called twice on a . Instead, use a.copy() to create a duplicate with identical state: >>> a = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> d = iso . PDict ({ \"p1\" : a . copy (), \"p2\" : a . copy () }) >>> next ( d ) { 'p1' : 1 , 'p2' : 1 } Resetting a pattern To rewind a pattern to its initial state, call pattern.reset() . This restores all state variables to their original values. Stochastic patterns Stochastic patterns each have their own independent random number generator state. This allows them to be seeded with a known value to create repeatable pseudo-random number sequences. >>> a = iso . PWhite ( 0 , 10 ) >>> a . seed ( 123 ) >>> a . nextn ( 16 ) [ 0 , 0 , 4 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 0 , 4 , 0 ] >>> a . seed ( 123 ) >>> a . nextn ( 16 ) [ 0 , 0 , 4 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 0 , 4 , 0 ] Static patterns The state of a regular pattern steps forward each time the next() method is called. The state of a static pattern, conversely, is not modified by a call to next() . This means that next() may be called multiple times and return the same value each time. Static pattern classes include: PStaticPattern : When called as PStaticPattern(pattern, duration) , wraps a regular pattern and returns a new static pattern. Each new value of the inner pattern is returned for a specified duration in beats (see example below). The duration parameter may also be a pattern. PCurrentTime : Returns the current Timeline's time, in beats. PGlobals : See Globals . Static patterns can be used to impose temporal structure on a piece. For example, to modulate over a set of keys: #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Create a pattern which is an alternating pair of Keys. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- key_sequence = iso . PSequence ([ iso . Key ( \"C\" , \"minor\" ), iso . Key ( \"G\" , \"major\" ), ]) #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Create a static pattern embeds the key_sequence pattern. # Each value will be held for 4 beats before progressing to the next value. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- key_static = iso .
